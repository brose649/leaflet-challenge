# leaflet-challenge
This repository contains the Module 15 Challenge of the 2024 Data Boot Camp covering mapping and advanced interactive visualizations using JavaScript

This challenge introduced us to leaflet, the library within JavaScript to build interactive web maps.

The most rewarding part was figuring out how to convert the UNIX timestamp into a readable date to display in the popup, making the popup much more interesting and useful.

I also enjoyed making the heatmap, however I may change the color intensity to further highlight density at more zoomed in levels.
